The [Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal](https://covid19dataportal.se/) invites researchers and general public to take part in the **COVID-19 Data & Code Reuse Competition**. Participants should complete small-scale projects that make use of publicly shared data and/or code to combat the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemics.

We welcome various types of project. The projects could, for example, involve the re-analysis of existing publicly available data using a different method, or focus on a different aim, or  reuse publicly shared code to process a new set of data. Other possibilities include projects that produce individual visualisations, dashboards presenting publicly shared data in a novel way or web-services devoted to data and analyses. The emphasis of the projects submitted should be to maximise the utility of existing data and/or code.

If you are interested in participating in the competition and might need support from the Covid-19 Data Portal team members, please feel free to contact us at [datacentre@scilifelab.se](mailto:datacentre@scilifelab.se).

#### Who can submit an entry?

- The competition is **open to everyone**; research (students, PhD candidates, postdocs, researchers, etc.) and public.
- Entries can be submitted either by **individuals or groups**. Collaborative projects are welcome.

#### How does the competition work?

- Participants are invited to enter small-scale projects that contribute to the understanding of SARS-CoV-2, the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic or combatting future pandemics. The submitted projects should have a clear goal and outcome.
- Each competition entry must reuse data and/or code that has been made available in a public repository or assigned a DOI. You may search for data or code through the [Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal](https://covid19dataportal.se/), the [European COVID-19 Data Portal](https://covid19dataportal.org), and other [national COVID-19 Data Portals](https://covid19dataportal.se/partners/). Be sure to adhere to the license conditions under which the original data or code were published.
- Participants are welcome to reuse their own data or code for new projects, as long they have been made publicly available before the competition entry is submitted.
- Participants retain all rights to their project and are welcome to use the project outcome in any way they wish, including as part of further work or in publications.

#### How to submit an entry?

- Submit your project outcome (e.g. a PDF, a poster, a presentation, a dashboard, or a link) as an entry to the [SciLifeLab Data Repository](https://scilifelab.figshare.com/). You can log in with your Swedish university user ID or, if you are not affiliated with a Swedish university, you can get in touch with the SciLifeLab Data Centre at [datacentre@scilifelab.se](mailto:datacentre@scilifelab.se) to obtain an account.
- Any newly generated data, code and other materials should be made publicly available as part of the SciLifeLab Data Repository item submitted as an entry.
- Follow the SciLifeLab Data Repository [submission guidelines](https://www.scilifelab.se/data/repository/submission/) to add your entry.
- Provide information about and a link to, the source of the original data or code reused in the project in the "Description" field of your entry.
- Add the keyword “COVID-19 Data & Code Reuse Competition” in the “Keywords” field of your entry.
- Competition entries will go through the standard review process of the SciLifeLab Data Repository. Please note that the review process can take about one week. Your submission must be approved and published by the deadline.
