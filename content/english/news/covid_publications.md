The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has caused a global public health crisis, and challenged societies over the last year and a half. The pandemic has also, in a short time, transformed scientific research publishing. Researchers, especially those working in life sciences, have in record time changed their focus in order to fight the pandemic. This research contributed to developing novel treatments, therapies, and vaccines for COVID-19.

A large number of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 related journal articles and preprints can found in publication databases such as [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/), and others. Accoring to Fraser and colleagues (2021, PLoS Biology, DOI: [10.1371/journal.pbio.3000959](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000959)) over 120.000 COVID-19 related scientific articles were published within the first ten month of the pandemic. Out of these, 30.000 were added to preprint servers. Else and colleages (2020, Nature, DOI: [10.1038/d41586-020-03564-y](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-03564-y)) estimated that 6% of all articles added to PubMed in 2020 were related to COVID-19. Earlier this year, Ioannidis and colleagues (2021, bioRxiv, DOI: [10.1101/2020.12.15.422900](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.15.422900v2)) estimated that there were over 130â€¯000 COVID-19-related published scientific articles. Please note that the estimated number of publications varies depending on which database was used (the former used PubMed whereas the latter used Scopus), coverage, and definitions used for searches.
