The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has caused a global public health crisis, and challenged societies over the last year and a half. The pandemic has also, in a short time, transformed scientific research publishing. Researchers, especially those working in life sciences, have in record time changed their focus in order to fight the pandemic. This research contributed to developing novel treatments, therapies, and vaccines for COVID-19.

A large number of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 related journal articles and preprints can found in publication databases such as [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/), and others. Accoring to Fraser and colleagues (2021, PLoS Biology, DOI: [10.1371/journal.pbio.3000959](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000959)) over 120.000 COVID-19 related scientific articles were published within the first ten month of the pandemic. Out of these, 30.000 were added to preprint servers. Else and colleages (2020, Nature, DOI: [10.1038/d41586-020-03564-y](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-03564-y)) estimated that 6% of all articles added to PubMed in 2020 were related to COVID-19. Earlier this year, Ioannidis and colleagues (2021, bioRxiv, DOI: [10.1101/2020.12.15.422900](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.15.422900v2)) estimated that there were over 130 000 COVID-19 related published scientific articles. Please note that the estimated number of publications varies depending on which database was used (the former used PubMed whereas the latter used Scopus), coverage, and definitions used for searches.

Overall, the number of scientific articles submitted to scientific journals has increased rapidly during 2020, independently of research subjects. For example, Squazzoni and colleagues (2002, SSRN, DOI: [10.2139/ssrn.3712813](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3712813)) found that the number of articles submitted to Elsevier’s journals between February-May 2020 increased 58% compared to the same period the previous year. In addition, the use of preprints has increased rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic. [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/) is currently the most used preprint server for COVID-19 related research, followed by [SSRN](http://ssrn.com/), [Research Square](https://www.researchsquare.com/), [RePEc](http://repec.org/), [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/), [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/), [JMIR](https://www.jmir.org/), and [Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/) (according to the above mentioned study by Fraser and colleagues). As Ioannidis colleagues state in their conclusion, the number of researchers involved in COVID-19 research, as shown by number of co-authors on COVID-19 related scientific articles, shows the rapid and massive response to the pandemic from the scientific research community.

One of the features of the Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal is an in-house [publications database](/publications/) launched in December 2020. The database is manually curated and contains all published scientific articles and preprints related to COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 from 2020 and onwards. The inclusion criteria for the database is that at least one co-author has an affiliation with a Swedish university or research institute. Besides being a part of the COVID-19 data portal website, the database can be downloaded as a JSON file and used for research. More information about the publications database can found in SciLifeLab Data Repository under the DOI: [10.17044/scilifelab.14124014](https://doi.org/10.17044/scilifelab.14124014).

According to our database, to date 1.400+ publications related to COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 have been published by Swedish researchers. Out of these, approximately 60% are research articles, 14% are reviews, and 25% are other (comprising comments, letters, editorials etc.).

[[[ Our [publications database](/publications/) also features a filtering function giving the possibility to filter for Field/Topic, Publication type, Year, and Major Funders. Data availability and Open Access publishing are other filtering functions. The current focus is to start the process of adding all Swedish preprints fronm 2020 to-date to the database making these available to search together with published scientific articles. The dashboard of Publications statistics shows the total growing number of published scientific articles and preprints from the start of the pandemic till today. Here we also feature the ten latest added publications and weekly updated word clouds. The wordclouds display the words and two word phrases that appear most frequently in titles (preprints or published scienctific journals) within the built Publications database, Note commonly used words and “COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2” have been filtered out, since these appeared in almost all titles. ]]]
