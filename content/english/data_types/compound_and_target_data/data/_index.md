## Published Data

On our portal, “Biochemistry” has a broad meaning, including cell- and plasma profiling with, for example, biomarker concentrations in plasma.

#### General useful data sources

* Small molecule related data can be found in [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/). ChEMBL is a manually curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties. It brings together chemical, bioactivity and genomic data to aid the translation of genomic information into effective new drugs.

* [IntAct Molecular Interaction Database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/) - a freely available, open source database system and analysis tools for molecular interaction data. All interactions are derived from literature curation or direct user submissions and are freely available. The database is manually curated; content is added by curators at the EMBL-EBI and partner organizations.

#### Data available on the European COVID-19 Data Portal
